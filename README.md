**üöÄ gmap  is a simple port scanning demo by Go. It can scan the ports of a target host and display the open ports.**

‚ú® This project is just a demo project, and there are many features yet to be implemented.

---

## ‚öóÔ∏è Features

- TCP connection scanning
- ICMP Ping scanning
- Scan a single IP address or a range of IP addresses
- CIDR notation support for scanning IP address range
- Multithreaded concurrent scanning for better efficiency
- Save scanning results to a file

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Karenina-na/gmap.git
```

```bash
# Enter the project directory and run the test
cd gmap
cd test
go test
cd ..
```

```bash
# Build the project (for windows)
go build -trimpath -gcflags="-l=4" -ldflags="-s -w -extldflags '-static'" -o gmap.exe main.go
./gmap.exe
```

## üöÄ Usage Example

ICMP Ping scan an IP range:
```bash
./gmap -m ping -ip 192.168.80.1-254
```

TCP scan a single IP:
```bash
./gmap -m tcp -ip 192.168.80.200 -p 80,8080
```

Specify the output file for results:
```bash
./gmap -m tcp -ip 192.168.80.200 -p 10-100 -o result.txt
```

Multithreaded concurrent scanning:
```bash
./gmap -m ping -ip 192.168.80.1-254 -tc 10 -tm 100 -tt 1000
```

Set the timeout for scanning (ms):
```bash
./gmap -m ping -ip 192.168.80.1-254 -t 1000
```

Set log level:
```bash
./gmap -m ping -ip 192.168.80.1-254 -mode info
```
